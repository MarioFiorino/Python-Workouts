# Python-Workouts
In this repository some proposed solutions (and some suggestions) to interesting exercises found on the web, in Python. New exercises and related solutions will be added. Requests to find solutions to Python problem of all kinds are welcome. Write me!


## Array subsets
Given an array of integers, divide the array into 2 subsets: A and B; while respecting the following conditions:
- The intersections of A and B is null
- The union A and B is equal to original array
- The number of elements in subset A is minimal
- The sum of A's elements is greater than the sum of B's elements

If more then one subset A exists, return the one with the maximal sum

## Degree of array 

Given an array of integer, its degree is defined as the number of occurrences of the element that occurs most frequently in array.
Determine two properties:
- Degree of the array given
- The shortest sub-array that share that degree

## Minimum unique array sum

Given an array, increment any duplicate elements until all elements are unique. The sum of the elements must be the minimum possible.
