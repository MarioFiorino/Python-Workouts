# Python-Workouts
In this repository some proposed solutions (and some suggestions) to interesting exercises found on the web, in Python. New exercises and related solutions will be added. Requests to find solutions to Python problem of all kinds are welcome. Write me!


## Array subsets
Given an array of integers, divide the array into 2 subsets: A and B; while respecting the following conditions:
- The intersections of A and B is null
- The union A and B is equal to original array
- The number of elements in subset A is minimal
- The sum of A's elements is greater than the sum of B's elements

If more then one subset A exists, return the one with the maximal sum

## Degree of array and more

Given an array of integer, its degree is defined as the number of occurrences of the element that occurs most frequently in array.
Determine two properties:
- Degree of the array given
- The shortest sub-array that share that degree

## First repeated word in a sentence
Given an sentence, find the first repeated word. Note: each sentence is bounded by comma,colon,semicolon,ect.

E.g. : 
input : " We work hard becouse hard work pays."

output: "hard"

## Maximum difference records

Given an array of integers, without reordering, determine the maximum diffrence between any element and any prior smaller difference.

E.g. :
input : [5,3,6,7,4]

out : The maximum trailing record is  l[3] -  l[1]  = 4

## Minimum unique array sum

Given an array, increment any duplicate elements until all elements are unique. The sum of the elements must be the minimum possible.

## Right triangles

Given an array of positive integers, find the number of orthogonal triangles that can be formed with three elements of this array.

## At the Zoo

Using object-oriented programming (OOP), is defined a zoo, with cages and animals. In addition, is given the opportunity to formulate queries about animals present in zoo.
